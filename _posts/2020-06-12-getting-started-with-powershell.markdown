This is where we begin to talk about the Power of PowerShell and all its glory. The below is traditional markdown.
```powershell
Get-ComputerInfo # This is an example of a Cmdlet
```
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight powershell %}
Get-ComputerInfo # This is an example of a Cmdlet
{% endhighlight %}
